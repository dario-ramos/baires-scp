# baires-scp

This is essentially a fork of Scamper's cvs-20210324 release from March 2021. Scamper is not on Github, so I basically copied their source ball
and started editing. 

The main goal of this fork is to add a new command to Scamper: Baires traceroute (traceb in the command line). This command sends probe packets back to back, without 
waiting for a response to send the next one.

 Secondary goals:
 
 * Add automated acceptance tests, initially covering the new command only.
 * Add unit tests for all the new functions, and modified pre-existing ones.
 * Implement design by contract to ensure quality for all new functions and modified pre-existing ones.
 * Add continuous integration.
 
 These goals are intended to ensure quality for the new command, while opening the door for adding that to the remaining commands.

## Running acceptance tests

Acceptance tests are built using [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a Python3 package.
To run the tests, [install behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html). Then, from the
project root directory, cd into the `tests` dir and run the `behave` command.

*Important*: these tests call the scamper binary generated by the `make` script in `$PROJECT_DIR/scamper/scamper`.
Therefore, for the tests to see changes in the code, this binary must be recompiled.
